# Connecting to a MQTT broker using TLS with simple authentication

The connection is TLS in server authentication mode, only the server is authenticated by means of its certificate.

This demo uses a set of certificates for the server, available [here](https://github.com/scaprile/generic_notes/tree/main/tls_server-certs)
