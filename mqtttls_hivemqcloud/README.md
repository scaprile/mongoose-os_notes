# Connecting to HiveMQ Cloud Basic
HiveMQ Cloud Basic is free for developers up to 100 concurrent connections (at the time I wrote this...). Great for proof-of-concept stuff.
Read their [Get Started document](https://www.hivemq.com/docs/hivemq-cloud/introduction.html#get-started).

The CA certificate has been included, but if you have any problem check HiveMQ Cloud docs, you will need it.

The connection is TLS in server authentication mode, your devices need a valid user/password pair to be allowed access but nothing further.

See [my blog](http://www.scaprile.com/2021/05/23/connecting-to-hivemq-cloud-basic/) for further info.
